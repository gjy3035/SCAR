# SCAR
The code for "SCAR: Spatial-/Channel-wise Attention Regression Networks for Crowd Counting"

This is an official implementation of the paper "SCAR: Spatial-/Channel-wise Attention Regression Networks for Crowd Counting" (completed in **September 2018**, accepted by Neurocomputing in **August 2019**).

The original implementation of our paper is similar to this framework: [**GCC-SFCN**](https://github.com/gjy3035/GCC-SFCN). Recently, we re-implement SCAR using [**C^3 Framework**](https://github.com/gjy3035/C-3-Framework) and achieve a better performance than the original implementation. Thus, this repo provide the key code and hyperparameters in C^3 Framework.
